<b>Hello and welcome to Bitcoin.Review Episode 01!</b>

Scratching my own itch, this is a best efforts place to talk about Bitcoin Project software updates and some other commentary that I find interesting or noteworthy to me. I also would like to invite you to send Bitcoin related questions, just go to bitcoin.review and click submit story at the top right.
