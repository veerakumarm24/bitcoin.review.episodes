<b>Hello and welcome to Bitcoin.Review Episode 02!</b>

I Scratched my own itch with Episode 01, so this will keep going as my best efforts place to talk about Bitcoin Project software updates and some other commentary that I find interesting or noteworthy to me. I also would like to invite you to send Bitcoin related questions, just go to bitcoin.review and click submit story at the top right.

This week I have [Justin Moon](https://twitter.com/_JustinMoon_) and [Matt Odell](https://twitter.com/ODELL) helping me read the list.

### Bitcoin Optech Newsletter

- [208](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2022/07/13/)
    - Half aggregation of BIP340 signatures: Jonas Nick [posted](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-July/020662.html) to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a [draft BIP](https://github.com/ElementsProject/cross-input-aggregation/blob/master/half-aggregation.mediawiki) and [blog post](https://blog.blockstream.com/half-aggregation-of-bip-340-signatures/) about half aggregation of Bitcoin‚Äôs [schnorr signatures](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/schnorr-signatures/). As mentioned in the blog post, the proposal ‚Äúallows aggregating multiple schnorr signatures into a single signature that is about half as long as the sum of the individual signatures. Importantly, this scheme is non-interactive, which means that a set of signatures can be half-aggregated by a third party without any involvement from the signers.‚Äù 
        - Blockstream research - [BIP for non-interactive half-aggregation of BIP 340 Schnorr signatures.](https://blog.blockstream.com/half-aggregation-of-bip-340-signatures/) and [github](https://github.com/ElementsProject/cross-input-aggregation/blob/master/half-aggregation.mediawiki)
        - A [separate document](https://github.com/ElementsProject/cross-input-aggregation) provides examples of how half aggregation could benefit the operators of Bitcoin and LN nodes, plus several concerns that would need to be considered in the design of a soft fork adding half aggregation to the consensus protocol.

    - Long-term block reward funding 
    - [Bitcoin Core #24836](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24836) adds a regtest-only RPC, submitpackage, to help L2 protocol and application developers who intend to use [package relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/package-relay/) in the future test their transactions against the Bitcoin Core default package policy. The current policy is outlined [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/09f32cffa6c3e8b2d77281a5983ffe8f482a5945/doc/policy/packages.md). This RPC can also be used to test future additions and changes, such as the proposed package RBF rules.
    - [Bitcoin Core #22558](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22558) adds support for [BIP371](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0371.mediawiki)‚Äôs additional [PSBT](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/) fields (see [Newsletter #155](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/06/30/#psbt-extensions-for-taproot)) for [taproot](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/).
    - [BDK #611](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/611) begins setting the nLockTime of new transactions to the height of the most recent block by default, enabling [anti fee sniping](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/fee-sniping/).
- [206](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2022/06/29/)
    - [What is the largest multisig quorum currently possible?](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/114048) Andrew Chow lists the different possible multisig types (bare script, P2SH, P2WSH, P2TR, P2TR + [MuSig](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/musig/)) and the multisig quorum restrictions for each.
