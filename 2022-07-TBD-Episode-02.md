<b>Hello and welcome to Bitcoin.Review Episode 02!</b>

I Scratched my own itch with Episode 01, so this will keep going as my best efforts place to talk about Bitcoin Project software updates and some other commentary that I find interesting or noteworthy to me. I also would like to invite you to send Bitcoin related questions, just go to bitcoin.review and click submit story at the top right.
